              <p>I don't have much experience with coding, apart from casual interest. I started becoming interested in coding after a friend of mine graduated <em>Epicodus</em> and started her career in programming. I thought i'd give it a try to see if I liked it, and if I <strong>did</strong>, that I would go to  for it! Aside from that I have listed my work experience here in order, from first job to latest job:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Winter Park Veterinary Hospital: (2006-2009) I worked as a CVT in the hospital, and as a Laboratory Technician.</li>
                <li>Lush: Fresh Handmade Cosmetics: (2009-2016) I started as a Sales Associate before moving up to Inventory Specialist, Inventory Manager, Trainer, and then Junior Manager.</li>
                <li>Apple Inc.: (2016-Present) I started as a Sales Specialist and have moved on to Operations Specialist since then.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I am enjoying my time here at <em>Epicodus</em> so far, and I look forward to career in programming of my own someday soon!</p>

                <p id="para">As Ron says, I'm a pretty simple person with some good, sturdy hobbies. My favorite things to do are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cook - I'd like to think im pretty good at it. I'm certainly passionate about it! All of my favorite media (books, T.V., websites) have something to do with food. My favorite genre of food to make is anything Italian, especially fresh pasta and ravioli. Italian food is all about letting the ingredients speak and about putting time and thought into it, which really speaks to me.</li>
                  <li>Read - I love to read, anything and everything. My favorite thing about reading is the socially acceptable alone-and-quiet-time that comes along with it. I'd have to say that my favorite genre would be fantasy though, anything happening in a made-up land with made-up creatures is amazing to me!</li>
                  <li>Watch Movies - I love movies, especially anything made by David Fincher. He has that beautiful darl color pallette that he uses that I love.</li>
                  <li>Play Board Games - I love stratagy games and collectable card games (my favorite is Star Wars: Destiny). Anything with a lot of pieces and some thought involved has my name all over it. <a href="mailto:lewdavidson47@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you want to get together for games any time!</li>
