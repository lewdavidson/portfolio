    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>I don't have much experience with coding, apart from casual interest. I started becoming interested in coding after a friend of mine graduated <em>Epicodus</em> and started her career in programming. I thought i'd give it a try to see if I liked it, and if I <strong>did</strong>, that I would go to  for it! Aside from that I have listed my work experience here in order, from first job to latest job:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Winter Park Veterinary Hospital: (2006-2009) I worked as a CVT in the hospital, and as a Laboratory Technician.</li>
      <li>Lush: Fresh Handmade Cosmetics: (2009-2016) I started as a Sales Associate before moving up to Inventory Specialist, Inventory Manager, Trainer, and then Junior Manager.</li>
      <li>Apple Inc.: (2016-Present) I started as a Sales Specialist and have moved on to Operations Specialist since then.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am enjoying my time here at <em>Epicodus</em> so far, and I look forward to career in programming of my own someday soon!</p>
